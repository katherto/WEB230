# WEB 230 AJAX

These are the various projects and assignments covered in class for the fall 2019 semester at JCCC.  This course was the best I had all year as it helped enforce better JavaScript habits and methods of coding.  This was also the first time I've been able to use a scripting language to perform fetches to an API and use the data to build a webpage.  These projects were created using my CodeSandbox and are still hosted there and working.
